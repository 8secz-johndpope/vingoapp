In itself a family portrait set in an interior is a simple and natural idea; it could have been intimate and emotional, but ever true to himself, the artist moved beyond mere intimacy to make the composition monumental and majestic. The structure of this large canvas is unusual. Matisse takes us into a world of whimsical patterns - now childishly naive, now of oriental complexity - which incorporate the draughts board, one of the most important elements in the painting. This patterning might have threatened the compositional unity of the work, but Matisse, as it were challenging the multiplicity of colours and lines he had created, managed to achieve clarity and logic through careful organisation of the canvas. The figures play the central role in establishing the unity of the painting. It is they - as always in the artist's works shown with a clear and simple outline - who contain, concentrated within themselves, the most resonant colour: the red of the boy's clothes, and black dress and the lemon-yellow book. Matisse has created a vast, tense world, the air vibrant with deep spiritual concentration, which seems almost tangible in the blue-black of the mirror over the fireplace.

His many new, strong impressions gained during that first acquaintance with the Orient, the direct contact with a world so very different from his own, demanded new means of expression adequate both to his thoughts and emotions and to the Orient itself. Avoiding overt oriental exoticism and ethnographical pedantry, Matisse filled the painting with his joy at the natural informality of the model, joy at the sun, joy at light-filled colour. The youth, a stable-hand at a Tangiers hotel, stands easily and naturally, the narrow canvas format complementing his long-legged, light figure. Matisse captures the dark skin, the bright white shirt, the pure colours of the waistcoat and short trouserss. The figure of Amido has mass and volume and yet is somewhat asymmetrical, twisted in space, creating a sense of dynamism, despite the boy's calm pose. Matisse selected this painting for the Moscow collector Sergey Shchukin.

Amongst these was Zorah Standing, produced by the artist in late 1912 during his second trip to Morocco. The painting was conceived as a pair to a portrait of the Moroccan boy Amido, also in the Hermitage. Both paintings are on canvas of identical size, and yet the resonance of Zorah Standing makes it a very different work to the portrait of Amido. The whole structure of the painting, its composition and colour, reveal the deep impression made on the artist by Persian miniatures and by Russian icons - he became acquainted with the latter during a journey to Moscow in the autumn of 1911. In Standing Zorah he transformed them, and the artist's favourite model became a symbol of the whole of the mysterious East, full of magic, with the scent of spices in the air. The picture space was subjugated to the flat surface of the canvas. Zorah, wearing dark green, is set frontally and stands out sharply against the bright raspberry-orange background. The white edging with its ornamental black dots introduces a broken rhythmic feel into the almost monotone colour of the figure and reinforces its sense of weightlessness. The transfixing magic of colour, the sorcery in the fixed gaze of those clearly outlined, exaggeratedly almond-shaped eyes - everything embodies the great mystery of the alien culture which provided Matisse with such an intense creative impulse.

Combined, these two colours give birth to the green of the luxuriant hair which forms a marvellous crown on the woman's head.

Amelie posed for her husband in a green garden chair, looking elegant, relaxed and firmly in control. Her pose is precisely but simply conveyed, her erect back and her perfect dress-sense making her the very epitome of the Parisian \"dame\". The artist made use of the traditional scheme of an official, society portrait, but gave it a totally untraditional resonance. Amelie's face lies in greenish shade. The simple outline and severely schematic features recall a mask, something which not only hides the inner essence of the sitter but embodies some mysterious content which cannot be explained by logic or clarity.

Matisse mixed areas of colour with patches of unpainted, white primed canvas, which are particularly effective when used to set off the colour of the flowers.

As in \"Spanish Still Life\" (1910, Hermitage), the artist chose to paint a corner of his hotel room. But when we compare it with the works of 1904 to 1910, this painting has a new, direct freshness in the depiction of nature. On the dressing table with its marble top, Matisse placed a vase of irises in what seems to be a classical, standard composition. But this was only an excuse for an exploration of the realms of light and colour. The energetic strokes of lilac paint underline the naturally ornamental form of the petals and the small areas of white canvas surrounding the flowers and their strong green stems introduce light without reducing the resonance of the colour. The warm brownish-red surface of the wood and pottery is marvellously tangible and complements the cool surface of the stone. But this tangible world exists side by side with a mysterious world \"Through the Looking Glass\", where everyday rules cease to hold sway, where the mirror does not reflect the surroundings but is instead filled with a strange light and a mysterious blackness. The colour transformation of space continues also in the background of the painting, in which we can see strange green tones flickering out of the black.

They were commissioned in 1910 by one of the leading Russian collectors of French late 19th and early 20th-century art, Sergey Shchukin. Until the Revolution of 1917, they hung on the staircase of his Moscow mansion. Both compositions belong to a group of works united by the theme of \"the golden age\" of humanity, and therefore the figures are not real people but imagined image-symbols. The sources of Matisse's \"The Dance\" lie in folk dances, which even today preserve something of the ritual nature - albeit not always comprehended today - of pagan times. Before this canvas, the theme of the dance passed through several stages in Matisse's work. Only in this composition of 1910, however, did it acquire its famous passion and expressive resonance. The frenzy of the pagan bacchanalia is embodied in the powerful, stunning accord of red, blue and green, uniting Man, Heaven and Earth. How rightly has Matisse captured the profound meaning of the dance, expressing man's subconscious sense of involvement in the rhythms of nature and the cosmos! The five figures have firm outlines, while the deformation of those figures is an expression of their passionate arousal and the power of the all-consuming rhythm. The swift, joint movement fills the bodies with untamed life force and the red becomes a symbol of inner heat. The figures dance in the deep blue of the Cosmos and the green hill is charged with the energy of the dancers, sinking beneath their feet and then springing back. For all its expressiveness, Matisse's \"Dance\" has no superfluous emotion, other than that required by the subject. The very organisation of the canvas ensures that. Instinct and consciousness are united into a harmonious whole, as we can feel in the balance between centrifugal and centripetal forces, and in the outlines of the figure on the left, strong and classical in proportion.

After the collector Sergey Shchukin commissioned \"The Dance\", he wrote to Matisse asking for another panel on the subject of music. It is only when seen together that they acquire their full resonance. Matisse worked on the huge canvas for \"Music\" without preparatory sketches and rethought the composition numerous times. The canvas thus bears the traces of numerous alterations, and we can almost trace all the steps in the artist's difficult search for the desired effect. Once complete, the central idea of the Shchukin ensemble was man's achievement of a state of completeness through passionate immersion in creativity. \"Music\" is built up of the same three elements as \"The Dance\": the same expressive harmony of green, red and blue; the five simplified figures of musicians and singers accord with the five dancers; as in \"The Dance\", Man is one with Earth and Heaven. He has mounted the hill, torn himself away from everyday routine and become an image-symbol, existing outside of time and space. But \"Music\" amazes us with its concentrated calm, the absolute immobility of the isolated figures, the total concentration on the playing of musical instruments and singing. The open mouths seem to resonate and force us to physically experience the human voices pouring from within. Whilst the figures, who seem almost like musical notation on a page, are totally enclosed within themselves, the music unites them in a single whole, the violin-playing conductor acting as the central figure in the composition.

Executed in the early part of 1913, it was acquired by the Moscow collector Sergey Shchukin later that year. He wrote to Matisse \"I love [the painting] now more than the others and I look at it for no less than an hour at a time.\" Before us is the epitome of absolute inner peace; the still figures are cut off from the world around, as if they had lost consciousness of their bodily weight. They are grouped around two central elements: the glass aquarium with the goldfish in the foreground and the musical instrument being played in the background. These two objects are the origin of the meditative state which holds the figures in its power. This state of enchantment is perfectly matched by the magic of the expansive space of the turquoise colour and the calm light grey of the figures, set off by patches of warm ochre. The painting evolved slowly. At first it contained more concrete observations of nature and greater variety in colour, but gradually everything superfluous was removed and Matisse used his expressive simplification to capture the Spirit of the East.

The arrangement of the figures, the incline of the heads, the schematic facial features, all give us some idea of what each player is feeling: there is the total concentration of the boy about to throw his boule, the expectant interest in the result of the other boy, the calm of the seated figure. But at the same time there is something strange, sad and mysterious in the composition. Some kind of primeval silence in which the earth, water, sky and man, the central elements in the world, are all sunk. The game is to be perceived as one manifestation of man's creativity. The \"game\" is in the highest sense a form of cognition, an instrument to use in understanding the \"codes\" of life. Matisse turns to man's mythological past, to times when the mystery of being was more central to everyday life. The participants in the \"action\" seem to have frozen, each \"held\" in the surface, although the sense of volume and mass has not totally disappeared. The Game of Bowls is one of a cycle of works of 1905 to 1910, united by the theme of man's \"golden age\".

Only slightly smaller than \"The Red Room\", the images are simplified, minimalised. The central figures of Matisse and his wife Amelie are schematic, while still retaining a portrait likeness. Most importantly, whilst depicting a moment in real life, Matisse \"captures the truer and more profound meaning behind it, which serves the artist as a point of departure for a more consistent interpretation of reality,\" as he himself wrote in 1908. We enter into the blue world of the \"Conversation\", sink deep into the atmosphere of colour. The blue colour does not represent solidity; this is not the colour of the carpet or the colour of the wall. Filling a large part of the paintign space, the blue bears the concept of space through the force of the associations it gives rise to. It is cold; it is emotional and significant; it excites us with its profundity. Submitting to the blue's dominance, the green becomes not only the colour of the meadow but a symbol of the earth, a symbol of Life, an image which is reinforced by the straight, strong trunk of \"the tree of life\". In this ideal world of pure light-colour we find two figure-symbols embodying the two eternal sources of Life. In the contrast and mutual attraction of the straight lines (male) and the soft, emotional, lines curving (female) lies one of the mysteries of existence.

Scholars have had no difficulty identifying the sitter - who appears in a number of works created that summer - in this clear portrait likeness: the straight back and slender neck, the confident holding of the head, the pointed oval of the face. But this painting is not intended to be a portrait; the emphasis is on the supra-individual, something far beyond the sitter's character, and thus, ignoring the sitter's identity, the painting bears a neutral title, \"Woman in Green\". The profound, intense, complex green colour is not simply decorative, it arouses a sense of the cool of the watery depths and of dense vegetation, it becomes the embodiment of mystery and life. Yet the magic of the dominant green cannot prevent us from perceiving the human figure, firmly and simply outlined, totally enclosed within itself. The young woman is calm, majestic and a little mysterious, her bottomless black eyes looking rather into themselves than at us. On the light green blouse, dead in the centre of the painting, burns the sole bright patch, the red carnation.

They are the main theme of my work,\" wrote Matisse in 1908. There is something gentle and melancholy, something fragile and refined in the face and slightly asymmetrical figure of the girl whom Matisse and his wife affectionately called Jeannette. The girl was also the model for a number of other works, including a series of bronze heads. The interaction between the flowers and the human figure forms the central theme of the work. The strong stems of the tulips forcing themselves upwards in an expression of rebirth and the coming spring, the thick green colour of the sharp leaves, everything carries within it the energy of growth.

The artist himself called this a \"decorative panel\" and it was intended for the dining room in the Moscow mansion of the famous Russian collector Sergey Shchukin. Matisse turned to a motif common in the works created that year: a room decorated with vases, fruits and flowers. Yet, as he wrote in 1908, \"the basis of my thinking has not changed, but the very thinking has evolved and my means of expression have followed on.\" The luxuriant raspberry red fabric with its energetic twists of blue pattern seems to sink down from the wall, taking over the surface of the table and uniting it in a single whole, swallowing up the three-dimensional space of the room and masterfully confirming the decorative potential of the canvas surface. Matisse first made such uncompromising use of this compositional device here, in \"The Red Room\". But in affirming the flatness of the red colour, the artist managed to create within it the impression of space, space within which the female figure bending over the vase could move and within which the sharp angled view of the chair seemed natural. The window, through which we see a green garden with flowering plants, allows the eye to move into the depths of the canvas.

In two Hermitage canvases, \"Seated Woman\" and \"Nude. Study\", we can see how Matise worked towards the final, majestic chord of this painting, \"Nude. Black and Gold\". Matisse was to choose this work to illustrate his writings on art. The artist preserved the classical pose of the figure found in \"Nude. Study\", but he brought her forward, enlarged her, changing the angle just a little, making the model's figure the absolute centre of the canvas. The effect was to radically alter the spacial context. Removing the pale ground which created the illusion of space and the elements of an interior, the image of the woman has become not a depiction of a physical being, but something more profound and monumental. Matisse used black and yellow to mould the figure, but the colours were not intended to represent light and shade; they exist independently, they are of formal, painterly, significance. The daring contrast of black and gold reminds one of old bronze, covered with the dark patina of time, through which comes the occasional gleam of gold.

Once again the artist chooses to depict naked bodies against a background setting, but the mood is different. The hills rise softly up towards the sky, the pure earth is quiet, the aquamarine of the water is calming. And into this world of gentle greenish-blue tones Matisse introduces two sharp colour accents, pink in the nymph's body and red for the satyr. The outlines of their bodies are extremely simplified and precise, concentrating the passion of the chase, the satyr's desire to possess, as the helpless nymph stumbles and becomes fated to be his victim. Such open eroticism is unusual for the artist. The theme calls up associations with the ancient myths of Apollo and Daphne, Pan and Syrinx, incorporating the eternal conflict of the two sexes, passion and escape.

Here, however, the composition reveals a new view of the familiar motif. The table and sofa have come nearer to the front of the canvas, forcing out the objects we saw in the foreground of \"Seville Still Life\". The areas of colour have become larger and more intense in tone, resulting in a change in the painting's ornamental rhythm. A large, precise pattern covers the fabrics, particularly in the lower and middle parts of the painting. But this ornamental luxury is not absolute: the energetic drawing of the tablecloth and the attention-grabbing stylized fruits and flowers on the dark blue cloth cannot outdo the living charm of the flowering geranium and peppers on the table.

Although the fabric was subjugated to Matisse's artistic will, repeatedly changing its colour and pattern, moving now further from, now closer to, the original, it is always easily recognisable. The artist's love for particular objects runs through many works, and this still life also includes a familiar fruit vase and hot-chocolate pot, seen already in \"Crockery on a Table\" (1900, Hermitage). Matisse took a daring and inspired approach in \"Still Life with Blue Tablecloth\", as if making use of the full potential of this device of richly patterned fabric descending, sinking down, from top to bottom. Unlike \"The Red Room\", where the fabric was just one, if striking, form-shaping and emotional element, and where the dialogue with the window was equally important, here the fabric-tablecloth is uncompromisingly the central element, its energetic pattern twisting up across the whole surface of the painting. It is this play between turquoise blue and the dark, dynamic blue of the pattern which holds the viewer's attention. The chocolate pot and bottle create a tentative sense of space, but neither they nor the edge or opening in the right part of the painting can lessen the intense life of the colour surface of the canvas.

Matisse worked on these compositions in his hotel room in Seville, and we can identify its characteristic interior in both works - the furniture and the items on the table, the pot with the geranium and the two ewers. But the artist transforms the room with Spanish shawls, sets the canvas off in a complex and engrossing play of line and colour, making it resonate with decorative and emotional notes. The atmosphere of southern exoticism in \"Seville Still Life\" is perfectly expressed in the whimsical ornament of the emerald sofa, which includes flowers and birds, the bright flowering geranium, the small dark pattern of the yellow shawl on the chair, the contrasts and exchanges between intense areas of colour and inventive ornament. Everything reinforces the suffocating garishness of the interior, but here the light green curtain introduces a hint of a breath of fresh air and makes the unseen window almost tangible.

In the garden near the house Matisse built himself a spacious, light studio, and it was here that he painted such large Hermitage canvases as \"Conversation\" (the window in the picture looks out over the studio), \"The Dance and Music\". The wall of the studio forms the background to the still life, and can be seen in a number of works from this period. Matisse liked to introduce his own works into his compositions, as here with the pink statuette of the woman leaning on her elbows. Matisse valued the statuette highly and included it in several paintings. Although it remained clearly recognisable on each occasion, he changed the colour, now accentuating the twists of the female form, now calming them and subjugating them to the individual canvas. Like the ewer and small jug, the flexible stem of the nasturtium and the bowl, the statuette becomes not simply a real object, but an object specific to this composition. The waving lines of the pink sculpture in the centre of the painting, like the ewer, are intensively worked up in colour, determining the dynamic rhythms of the still life, while the horizontal-vertical articulation of the walls introduces clarity and calm.

Matisse used the same model as in the Hermitage's Seated Woman and once again the figure is set in a reasonably well-defined interior.

The pose of the naked body and the position of the hands holding the fabric around the thighs recall some ancient, eternal piece of Greek sculpture, an image of Aphrodite. The model's body has lost any living sensibility and is clearly more classical in its proportions than in the Seated Woman. Matisse presented the painting to the Russian artist and collector Ilya Ostroukhov, as is confirmed by the inscription in Matisse's own hand in the left corner of the canvas.

Here we see how the artist applied his discoveries in the spheres of colour, drawing and composition to the nude body. A black outline runs round the large, relaxed figure, the greenish-yellow colour creating a feeling of natural light in the life drawing class or studio. The outline is now clear, now breaks off, now almost totally disappears but does not act as a barrier between the light and the body, its mass revealed through a skilful use of light and shade.

He was working in the genre favoured by the Impressionists, but as in his still lifes, he introduced his own logic and approach to create a very different world from theirs. \"I prefer to sacrifice Impressionist charm in order to achieve greater certainty,\" wrote the artist. \"The Luxembourg Gardens\" is built up of large areas of colour. It creates the effect of a stained glass window, but the transformation of the world is undertaken through a fine understanding of the objective and expressive potential of colour. In heightening the decorative nature of the scene, Matisse is not taking liberties with reality, for colour is used to create the sense of a brightly lit day, captured in the dominant cold tones and the fiery red wood. Pure colour can be used not only to split space apart - Matisse creates an alternation of cold shadows and warm bands of light - but also to compress it by using an equal intensity of colour in both foreground and background. Matisse simplifies forms and omits details, except where they contribute to the creation of the overall image. To bring out the individuality of this avenue in the Luxembourg Gardens, he underlines the ovals of the trimmed trees, the free, untamed crowns of others, and low wavy line of the border running round the lawn. Matisse himself said: \"Where is the interest in copying nature? What is important is the feeling which arises between the object and the artist, and the strength with which he organises his feelings and emotions.\" ","category":"Painting","author":"Matisse, Henri. 1869-1954","country":"France","created":"circa 1901","room":437,"image":"static/hermitage_staff/items/28369.jpg"},{"id":28371,"type":"01.+Paintings","title":"View of Collioure","original_image":"https://pano.hermitagemuseum.org/backend/files/d/f45e384b-ea4b-48eb-8466-947e1f7c5ed3-normal.JPEG","description":" Collioure was a small southern French town on the shore of the Mediterranean where Matisse worked in the summer of 1905 and the spring and summer of 1906. This view of the town is usually dated to 1905. The world is flooded with sunlight, it radiates joy in life and joy in painting. \"Everything must be created anew: both object and colour,\" said Matisse. The colouring is unbelievably intense. Matisse created a sense of the bright southern landscape and the blinding rays of the sun without the use of coloured shadows. Instead, he builds up a complex contrast of areas of orange, red, pinkish-lilac and raspberry, in the tiled roofs, the sunbaked earth, the walls of the houses and the belltower of the church above the sea. The antagonism between the reddish tones and the cold blue of the water reinforces the sense of sultriness. Areas of primed white canvas, untouched by paint, set off the colours and fill the canvas with additional light. In 1905 Matisse and his friends exhibited their work at the Salon d'Automne in Paris, an exhibition which was to go down in history. The artists amazed visitors with their radical daring and undulled colours, their simplified devices and their impulsiveness, which provoked the critic Louis Vauxcelles to describe them as wild beasts - \"fauves\". Thus the shortlived movement (1905-1907) to which Matisse's paintings at this time belonged is now known as Fauvism.

The woman seated on the open terrace is the artist's wife, Amelie. Unlike the Hermitage's \"View of Collioure\", this work shows no sign of small, fragmentary brushstrokes of pure colour. Everything is simplified to the extreme, the artist building up the composition of large planes of colour outlined with a coloured contour. Like colour, drawing is an important element in the painting and plays an active role in the rhythmic organisation of the picture surface. Giving an energetic outline to the horizontal balustrade, the yachts on the water, the soft hills and comfortable figure of his wife, Matisse creates a world in which we feel both the beat of the pulse of life, and majestic calm. The painting, with its tendency towards clarity and monumentality, seems to already hint at Matisse's coming departure from the Fauvist movement, of which he had been leader for several years.

Pure colours and dynamic brushstrokes fill the painting with the breath of life. Matisse took a direct impression of nature as his starting point, but from it he created a whole new world with its own laws rather than a slavish copy of reality. Hence he depicted no precisely defined interior, included no prosaic deatils. Making use of colour's own objective potential, Matisse contrasted flat areas of colour, building up not only a harmonious whole but an effect of space. The cool of the blue concentrated in the central part of the painting introduces depth, while the light-bearing yellow-orange seems to reaffirm the flatness of the painting. The verticals combine with the corner view of the table to establish the spacial coordinates of this interior, an interior with no shadows but entirely filled with light.

The red and black carpet in this still life, painted in Collioure, is clearly the work of folk masters and was brought back from Algiers. Matisse used it as the central motif in a number of works created during this period. Covered with stylised repeating ornament, the bright carpet spreads over almost the whole surface of the canvas. Laying out the fruit and crockery upon it, Matisse sought to \"restrain\" them in the flattened space, making them purely decorative areas of colour. Only the glass vessel proudly demonstrates its relative independence, its slender form introducing a vertical note into the rectangles which order the canvas.

But, as always in the work of Matisse, the painting is made up of a combination of \"feeling and logic\". The energetic rhomboid twist of the table forms a stable centre to the painting space. The bright, pure colour of the fruit, the uninsistent central axis formed by the milk jug and dark bottle, and the precise placing of objects around it, all introduce a classical clarity to the work. At the same time Matisse uses dynamic brushstrokes and the flickering areas of colour to transform his favourite blue tablecloth - also seen in \"The Red Room\" (1908) and \"Still Life with a Blue Tablecloth\" (1909; both Hermitage), but which changes in each work in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the painting. As X-ray study of the painting has shown, the still life was painted over another work, the dark tints of which show through the background. The artist covered the earlier painting with only a thin layer of white, over which he worked the ornamental strokes of yellow, red and green. The result is a marvelous example of his work during his Fauvist period.

The exhibition was to have an important influence on young artists and the colouring in this painting may owe some debt to a visit to the exhibition. Matisse's development in this direction, however, was already predetermined by his unique gift for colour. The pure colour in the still life is intense and rich. The deep and complexe lilac-violet, the powerful ring of the orange jug, which seemes to have absorbed the heat of the sun; the yellow lemon in the cold shade and the bright red handle, the colour of the latter seeming to find confirmation not only in the ripe tomato but in the whole painterly construction of the canvas.

In arranging these everyday objects on the canvas, Matisse explored the experience of his predecessors, taking up and moving beyond their painterly and compositional principles, actively seeking his own style. Light still draws the artist's attention; the softly modelled fruits, dish and cup exist within an almost tangible light environment. But they do not dissolve into that light; rather, the energetic moulding of the coffepot with broad brushstrokes increases the sense of mass, while the coloured contour emphasises each object. Colour has here acquired greater independence than was seen in earlier works. The intensity of the reflected colours on the surface of the coffeepot, the thick broad areas of coloured shadow on the tablecloth, all state the artist's increasing interest in this element. Matisse's world was becoming less dependent on concrete reality, and he created a greater distance from that reality by using a high viewpoint which enabled him to see the objects from a strange and unnatural angle.

Scholars have identified it as the most important still life he painted in that year. Matisse's interest in Impressionism was past and he was now completely won over to Cezanne's method of building form using colour. The picture space is strictly organised, dynamic and static elements both fixed in perfect equilibrium. Turning the surface of the table up towards the viewer within the rectangular field of the canvas, Matisse both splits apart the picture space and makes it more compact. Majestically unmoved in the centre of the composition are the hot-chocolate pot, the faience soup tureen, the cup and saucer. But the most important element is colour, which the artist liberates from its usual subordination to the natural colour of objects. He builds the painting up of deep blue and dulled, cold red reflections, in the context of which the pure colour of the bonbon dish, and the exotic lilac, rose and blue reflections on the soup tureen gain in brilliance. This still life was one of the milestones on the artist's path to his realisation that, for him, \"Colour is the first element in painting\".

with revealing fabrics that he produced a whole series of works on the subject, the most important of which is this early Cubist work, painted in the spring of 1907. The idea of the world's mystery - that the world can never be known or understood to the full - was characteristic of Spanish visual traditions and central to Picasso's view of the world. Deforming the structure of the human body, Picasso recreated it from separate movable surfaces covered with energetic hatching. Mixing them, twisting them, he made visible the tense, exciting spinning of the dancer. Like a medium, she seems to be listening to some mysterious music, her closed eyes evidence of her total immersion in its rhythms. Drapery and background too seem to be caught up in the revolving movement. Surfaces intersect one another, break up and shatter, while the black lines which cover them unite space and figure into a single whole.

The artist painted this work in Paris in early 1908. The massive figure of the female nude - who either drowses or simply sits with eyes closed - is extremely schematic, the architectonics of the body emphasized. Straight lines sharply differentiate the main elements of the figure, volume is built up through strong schematic contrasts of light and shade, dark ochre is the determining note in the colour scheme. Everything combines to create the sense of some sleeping, soulless matter, an effect which was to be characteristic of many of the artist's works.

The theme of man's loneliness in a cafe, of isolation and emptiness, was not new to French art in the second half of the 19th century and could be found in the works of Degas and of Picasso's much-admired Toulouse-Lautrec. But in the paintings by the young Spaniard the theme acquired a previously unknown sense of drama. Our lonely heroine sits at a table in a cafe, the background a dirty-red wall which reinforces the sense of discomfort. Emphasizing the flatness of the canvas, the colour of the walls and the bluish tone of the marble table seem to press the space inwards, around the woman, enclosing her in her hopeless loneliness. In the pose of the absinthe brinker, in her face, we can identify the outcast: the totally enclosed space of her body, the expressive distortion of the right hand, seem to indicate the tension of a coiled spring. Picasso strictly boxed in the immobile face - the hand acts as a support, its precise perpendicular running through the imperfect oval of the figure, while a protecting hand clasps the shoulder. Everything reinforces the sense of inner tension and cuts the figure off from the world around. On the basis of real observations in a cafe Picasso created a generalised and timeless symbol of the tragedy of life. On the back of the painting, concealed beneath heavy overpainting in blue and yellow, is a woman's head, probably a fragment of a work which did not satisfy the artist.

Amongst them is this portrait of Soler, a fashionable Barcelona tailor who patronised young artists in particular financial straits. The two men were friends for a number of years, and the artist produced several portraits of the tailor. In the Hermitage portrait Picasso conveys both the artistic nature and natural elegance of Soler's appearance, and the memorable thin face, the tips of the moustache twisted upwards in the manner of a dandy. But the artist did not seek to create a representation of the sitter or his character. He sunk Soler into an intensely melancholy world of dark blue and green, untouched by any hint of sunlight, making the sitter a bearer of that \"tragic sense of life\" which was so much a part of his own perception of the world. In this portrait, as in the earlier \"Absinthe Drinker\" (Hermitage), he is looking at the theme of man's loneliness in a cafe, of loneliness in a crowd. Hence the keen sense of melancholy and the sad expression of distance on the nervous face, its transparent pallor reinforced by the dark background and clothing.

Caught up in a desire to escape from the limits of mere visual likeness, seeking a symbolic system which would express essential concepts, he discovered the expressiveness of Iberian sculpture and African art. In 1906-1907 Picasso produced his renowned Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (Museum of Modern Art, New York), a work central which is considered to mark the birth of Cubism. He also produced a large number of sketches and independent works more or less related to the large canvas, amongst them this Hermitage work. The rough forms and the mask-like face indicate the artist's debt to African sculpture in his search for primeval, supra-individual forms which would be expressive, constructive and yet mysterious. For all the novelty of his emphatically geometric and schematic artistic language, Picasso managed to leave an expression of sorrow in the face, the lowered lids helping create that absolute concentration within the self which had been characteristic of the artist's Blue and Pink periods.

It is one of the most important items of his Blue Period, when the tragic mood of monochrome blue and bluish-green came to determine the whole structure of his paintings. \"Art flows from pain and sadness\" was Picasso's approach, which he realised with purely Spanish maximalism. He refracts through the prism of unhappiness and sorrow his observations of his friends, of the blind and poor, of sad mothers and prostitutes. During a visit to Paris, Picasso deliberately visited the Saint-Lazare hospital for prostitutes and made sketches there. On his return to Barcelona he wrote to his friend, the poet Max Jacob, \"I am going to paint a picture, a drawing for which I am sending you. The meeting of a prostitute from the prison hospital with her sister, a nun.\" From this very concrete origin, the Hermitage painting developed until it gained a universal character. In its static, symbolic nature, the composition recalls monumental religious art, summoning up direct associations with representations of the meeting of the Virgin Mary and the ageing Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist, and with the ascetic figures of medieval mourners. The women seem to form a human arch, an architectural entrance to a mysterious, cosmically endless world.

The small format canvas contains a bust-length image of a woman with a scarf around her neck, dynamic lines indicated the plasticity of face, reinforced by the use of colour. Energetically applied long strokes form a thick crown of coarse hair, the locks framing the sitter's eyes with their heavy sadness and fixed, unseeing gaze. Bluish-green tones dominate, but there is also a touch of dull red, the joyless colour of the scarf and the lips, as if the woman had made some helpless gesture to escape from the cold dark blue. This individual sitter is given the features of all the figures of Picasso's Blue Period, encapsulating Picasso's perception of sorrow as the very fabric of life, and all his thoughts on suffering, resignation and sympathy.

reveals the same principle of geometrical simplification of the plastic form and colour solution that was typical of the works produced by Picasso in different techniques in Paris in the spring of 1909. The artist is interested here rather in the representation of the ulterior structure of the form than in the portrayal of the individual. Although the image is divided into independent sections, the artist unites them into a single ornamental design by means of a strict outline. The laconic, almost ascetic, and harmonious combination of ochreous and grey tones is in keeping with the whole composition. Here Picasso rather strove to convey light and space than to show the richness of colours.

The artist's taste and style were formed under the influence of his keenness on the exotic Arabian fairy-tales and sumptuous ornamentation typical of Art Nouveau.

The sunlight which floods the paintings of the Impressionists - who did most of their painting out of doors, directly from nature - here plays the central role. Monet spent his childhood in Le Havre, which he periodically visited. The Le Coteaux estate at Sainte-Adresse near Le Havre belonged to Monet's cousin, Paul-Eugene Lecadre. Settling here in the summer of 1867, the artist painted several landscapes in the garden of the estate, of which \"Woman in the Garden\" is of central importance. Dressed in the fashion of the day, the figure of a lady was posed by Lecadre's wife. This lonely silhouette introduces an elegaic, sorrowful note into the painting whilst the bright, light area of the dress plays in important role in the balancing the composition and in demonstrating the interrelationship of light and colour.

For this purpose Monet took as his motif a blooming garden, and very successfully created an image of vivid, changing nature. The colouring, founded on the eye's combination at a distance of what are in fact separate brushstrokes of pure colour, is suffused with daylight and air, and the dynamics of this plein-air effect are reinforced by the vibrant paint surface. One of four decorative panels intended to adorn the large drawing room of the chateau of Rottenburg at Montgeron, it was commissioned by the owner of the residence, the financier Ernest Hoschede, one of the first patrons of the Impressionists. The three other works painted for the chateau are \"Corner of the Garden at Montgeron\" (St Petersburg, Hermitage), \"Turkeys\" (Paris, Louvre) and \"The Hunt\" (Paris, priv. coll.).

He captured views of Giverny in numerous canvases. A year before he painted this work in 1886, Monet had already shown a field of poppies (\"Poppy Field\", 1885; Paul Mellon Collection, USA), but without the haystack. The Hermitage work is one of the first of his paintings to show the haystack, which was to be the subject of whole series of works. Monet in virtuoso style captures the fine nuances of effects of light and air, picking the very moment at which the weather is changing and the horizon brightening on an overcast, windy day. The Impressionists painted such overcast weather with bright, light colours, which enabled them to capture the translucent sky and bring out the endlessly rich nuances of colour.

The urban theme was making its appearance not for the first time in his work, although Monet concentrated mainly on rural landscapes. In his cycle of London works, the central motif was the fog, the marvellous way in which it changed light and air and the very atmosphere, literally swallowing up buildings. The capturing of the moment's passing impression which gave Impressionism its name was replaced by an analysis of complex colour nuances in flickering, changing light. The artist's trips to London in 1889, 1900 and 1901 seemed to fall always in the foggy season. From his room in the Savoy Hotel, Monet had a view over the Thames towards Waterloo Bridge. The Hermitage canvas comes from a series showing this very view, works which were completed in the artist's studio at Giverny.

There is a whole group of canvases which take as their motif a field of poppies. Attracted by the vision of the fluttering, rippling colours of the moving carpet of flowers, the artist had already turned to this theme. In the Hermitage canvas he concentrates all his attention of conveying an impression of the massy surface swept sideways by the wind, and totally rejects any attempt to depict details. The modesty of the motif, which is characteristic of most of Monet's works, in no ways detracts from its poetry and the feeling that nature herself breathes within the picture.

The landscape motifs of this area were to come up time and time again in his works. In the summer of 1888, when this painting was produced, he repeatedly turned to the meadows and plains to the south of Giverny, painting them under different weather conditions, with different lighting effects. In this painting the artist skilfully conveys a fleeting moment in nature, a state of transition, when, just starting to pierce through the rain and the gusting wind which shakes the very crowns of the trees, comes the sun. In the clouds we see touches of pink appearing and the soaked meadows reflect warm patches of sunny light. The small, fragmentary brushstrokes, pressed close one to the other, create a solid yet vibrating paint surface and seem to reflect the very finest nuances of colouring.

An Impressionist to the core, faithful to the idea of conveying the dynamics of fleeting visual experiences, he created whole series of landscapes concentrating on one and the same motif, showing how nature changes depending on changes in the atmosphere and in the air.

Pissarro depicted this view at different hours of the day, in different weather conditions, creating a total of 13 paintings taken from the same viewpoint. Here the master skilfully conveyed the rich atmospheric effects, the complex colours and ethereal feeling of a gloomy day.

He manages to convey the atmosphere and the sunlight, giving the city a vivid charm. Like Claude Monet, Pissarro painted series of pictures of one and the same urban scene in a variety of very different weathers and conditions; in his case he took Paris as his main theme.

An overcast sky creates unique effects of light and air and it was this which attracted the artist and which he managed to convey whilst still using mainly light, bright tones, the pearly-grey colour scheme containing a multiplicity of vibrant nuances. The fluid, free brushstrokes follow the direction of the wind, conveying the swaying of the trees and the movement of the clouds. The Impressionist's keen eye catches the finest nuances of change in the sky, the most reliable and expressive reflection of changes in the weather. There is an intimacy and poetry in this landscape which is found in all of Sisley's work, and in this he is perhaps the true heir to the elegaic landscapes of Camille Corot.

The gentle landscapes which are characteristic of his work overall reveal a delicate understanding of the life and the poetry of the more modest aspects of nature. The Impressionist approach to painting allowed the artist to capture weather effects, and particularly the changing qualities of light and air. Sky is one of the most important components in any depiction of unspoilt nature and the artist used light, mobile brushstrokes to give a sense of the sky's complexity and dynamism. Water and reflections are also a frequently recurring motif in Impressionist art, and in the narrow river here we can see the current, almost feel it, as the reflection of the sky is broken up and seems to move on the surface of the water. This dappled reflection in water was for the Impressionists a symbol of the changeability of nature.

There is a similarly skilful use of colour reflections in the white cuffs and collar. The face is painted less broadly and in more detail. This device, characteristic of Renoir's portraits, is combined with a free, vibrant brushstrokes. It has been suggested that the sitter is Mme Hartmann, wife of the famous music publisher, although it is also possible that she is Anne, one of Renoir's models.

This portrait of her is perhaps one of the most famous of Renoir's many renowned canvases. The charming woman who, according to the artist, \"positively shone\", posed for him on a number of occasions, although mainly for half-length portraits. In this painting she stands against a background of potted palms and carpets, recreating the interior of a drawing room or - as is more likely - a theatre foyer. True to the Impressionist principle of painting life as it truly is, the artist showed the actress in her usual setting. The imposing nature of this portrait, which makes it much more official than Renoir's other works, reminds us that it was intended for exhibition at the Salon, in which mainly artists of the Academie took part. Yet the manner of execution has nothing in common with the art of the French Academie. In the soft, fluid contours, in the vibrant texture and in the finest of colour reflections, we see the hand of this mature master of Impressionism.

This sitter has a likeness to a number of figures who appear in the artist's other works of this period, both in her general appearance and in hairstyle. It is possible that this is Anne, one of Renoir's models. In the study, as in the artist's finished pictures, the image is tinged with lyricism and full of the charm of femininity.

The subject is five-year-old Etienne Goujon, dressed somewhat effeminately as was usual for little boys in the 1880s. Produced at a time when the artist was looking closely at the art of Ingres and of Raphael, seeking to revive a certain purity of drawing, this painting contains a contrast between the precise lines of the child's face and the freely applied brushstrokes of the Impressionist landscape. This style became known as Renoir's \"hard\" or \"Ingres\" style and it reflected the crisis in Impressionism, a crisis experienced by all the artists in the group. By the 1990s, the artist was to reject the use of hard lines and his painting was to become increasingly free and gentle.

The spontaneity and empiricism of Impression were here combined with the deliberation and precision of a carefully defined system, which also influenced the construction of such paintings, in which the \"chance\" Impressionist composition was replaced by the traditional centralised composition framed by \"wings\".

Acquaintance with the classic works of the Renaissance and especially with Raphael, coupled with admiration for the works of Ingrès forced him to take a fresh look at the question of form in painting and to think about bringing back to it drawing, which the Impressionists had so decisively rejected. In the Garden is one of the most significant works of what is known as the “dry” or “Ingrès period”. It was influenced by the marital bliss that Renoir had found with Aline Charigot, a young seamstress that he met in 1880. Considering himself too old to be depicted himself as the protagonist of the painting, Renoir asked his young friend and fellow artist Henri Laurent to pose for him. At that time the painter was 44 and his bride just 26. The subject that Renoir produced is more than simply a declaration of love. The young man’s steady expectant look as he gazes at the heroine suggests that he is asking for the girl’s hand and heart. She seems to be in no hurry to answer, lost i dreams of what is to come. The cross on her breast is an important element for the entire scene and testifies to the suitor’s serious intentions. The line, which Renoir had reintroduced into his artistic arsenal, made his painting more precise and definite, yet at the same time it remained Impressionistically free, dynamic and alive with sunny dabs of pure bright colour.

Landscape occupies an important place in the artist's work not simply as a component in portrait or genre subjects, but also as an independent theme. Renoir painted both urban and rural landscapes and like his fellow Impressionists he worked in the open air, seeking to capture transitory effects of nature and weather. Rejecting his hard style of the 1880s, Renoir developed a particular free and fluid painting manner, which we can see here in the picture of Le Cannet. The temperamental brushstrokes and rich colour scheme express that joyous attitude to life which never left Renoir, even in his later years.

Pointillism - the technique used to produce this work - is a method of painting in which the colour is applied in small dots of paint, the artist breaking complex tones up into pure colours which are then combined by the eye at a distance. The style is often described as Divisionism or Neo-Impressionism. The Impressionists had an empirical attitude to nature, while the Neo-Impressionists created their own methods on the basis of scientific theories of light and colour.

The figures here are the artist's mother and sister. Music-making was a popular theme with innovatory artists at this time and the subtitle of the work, \"The Overture to Tannhauser\", recalls Richard Wagner, who had become the symbol of the new kind of art. Restrained and tense in its colouring, which is based largely on a contrast of black and white, the painting has a strangely positive mood. The composition is balanced, with a sense of enclosure and unity, people and objects forming a single material world. The intimate scene has nothing everyday about it, and seems to have been transformed into something sublime and ceremonial. A friend of the Impressionists, showing his works at their exhibitions, Cezanne nonetheless soon discovered that his was a totally different view of the world, and took his own, independent artistic path.

The composition in fact recalls Pissarro's own \"Self-portrait\" (Musee d'Orsay, Paris). The free brushstrokes and interest in lighting effects reveal the Impressionist trend in Cezanne's work, but the sketchy painting and unclear outlines do not totally break down the weight and solidity with which the artist endowed the objects in his paintings. Even here, in these relatively early works of the Impressionist period, the artist revealed his individual view of art. In the picture Cezanne seems to be older than he in fact was, which was characteristic of him. Perhaps this was due not only to the beard but also to the artist's state of permanent state of inner tension and loneliness.

The artist uses vibrant colour reflections and the texture has become mobile and active. At the same time the solidity of form and density of the paint serve not so much to fix a passing impression of nature as to bring out nature's unchanging qualities. Cezanne took part in the Impressionist exhibitions and was the friend of the group's members, but with his very different vision of the world, which already appeared in these works from his Impressionist period, Cezanne was bound to move away from them artistically.

In Cezanne's painting, however, the reflection is still, the water seems to be frozen, like a mirror. Despite his friendship with the Impressionists, Cezanne rejected their approach to painting and sought to capture not the transitory but the permanent. The markedly centralised composition of the painting, framed by trees, is enclosed and stable. The brushstrokes follow the form of the object and model generalised shapes which are really more like simple geometrical bodies. The tonality of the colouring is determined by the green trees and bluish air, made almost thick and tangible by the will of the artist.

The calm, solid pose, the generalised face without any gestures or expression, the monumental figure, all give the image a classical majesty.

The very simplicity of the forms gives them a strange unity. Placing the objects such that they did not hide or detract from one another, Cezanne ensured that each expressed its full significance. Each object has a stable, unchanging colour, the blue tinge suggesting a certain thickness to the air.

He intially spent two years in Tahiti (1891-1893) before returning to Paris for a short time. This work dates from that first period in Oceania, when the artist was still more concerned with the external attributes of the exotic world full of mystery, so unlike Europe. The impressions of the colours and vegetation, the appearance and rituals of the Tahitians, gave the artistic much material to work with. An everyday episode in the islanders' life is here turned into the embodiment of the eternal rhythm of life, of harmony between man and nature. Standing in the foreground is a Tahitian girl with a fruit in her hand - the Eve of that eastern Paradise. Rejecting the rules of traditional painting, and then of Impressionism, Gauguin went on to create his own individual style. The flat space, the rhythmic repetition of lines, forms and areas of colour, and the pure colours applied in broad masses combine to create a highly decorative effect.

The yellow colour of the dunes is of particular importance in oriental art, while the woman's pose recalls figures on reliefs in temples on the island of Java. Central to the whole work is the theme of the flowering of nature in spring. In Europe we still celebrate May festivals, essentially derived from ancient pagan rituals celebrating the awakening of nature, while the May festivals of the Catholic Church are devoted to the Virgin Mary. The white of the woman's drapery is a symbol of purity to both Christians and Tahitians.

It is possible that this work contains some as yet unclear symbolic meaning, and yet at the same time it is a decorative work in which the artist achieved a harmony between areas of colour and rhythmic lines.

It is not so much a sculpture as an enigmatic being, the embodiment of life untouched by civilisation. The figure's outline echoes the gnarled, winding tree trunks while the gloomy colouring reinforces the disturbing mood.

Yet the subject dates back to the time of his friendship with van Gogh, in whose work the sunflower motif, a symbol of the sun, occupied a special place. In 1888, both artists worked together at Arles in Provence, and van Gogh painted a number of now famous still lives with sunflowers. Gauguin took to growing these flowers in Oceania from seeds sent specially from France. The artist's fantasy turns reality into mystery, the eye which takes shape in the centre of the flower in the background creating a mystical mood, recalling the \"all-seeing eye\" which is often found in Christian churches. The face in the window also has much in common with the blank features of Buddha. Thus the exotic land of Oceania was combined with nostalgic reminiscences of the Europe the artist had left behind.

Here he depicted a family of Tahitian islanders, although the idea for the painting is derived from a work by the French artist Puvis de Chavannes, \"The Poor Fisherman\". Gauguin's romantic imagination was fed not only by his impressions of Tahiti but also the works of other masters and other cultures - he was one of the first to find inspiration in the art of primitive and ancient peoples. This scene takes place in a different, exotic world, and all the lines in the painting are subordinated to the slow rhythm of that world. The pose of the seated fisherman recalls figures in ancient Egyptian paintings, while the frontal placing of the shoulders and the profile depiction of the knees also derive from ancient Egyptian art. With this in mind, the gesture of the Tahitian woman as she drinks from a coconut shell takes on almost the aspect of a ritual. Unfortunately the paints used in this work have changed irrevocably and thus the colours have lost something of their original resonance and vibrancy.

This painting from his second period would seem to be somehow linked with the islanders' religious beliefs. The habits, customs and beliefs of the Tahitians retained their link with nature, and in their life everything living was subjugated to a single, eternal rhythm. Rejecting traditional means of depiction, Gauguin created his own individual style to capture the images of an exotic world. The dark colouring gives this work a sense of enigma. Oceania's untouched landscape and wildlife was an inspiration to the artist and became for him the embodiment of the promised land.

The exoticism of the Tahitian landscape was an organic part of that image. The artist's inscription on the canvas can be translated as Word, Word, or Gossip, but although the women sitting in a circle are chatting, the everyday quality of the subject does not prevent a sense of mystery. Gauguin moved beyond the Impressionism which attracted him early in his career, developing his own, very individual style. In creating resonant combinations of colour masses, using linear rhythms and simplifying space, the artist achieved a very decorative effect in many of his canvases.

This work was painted during that first stay and it captures the idyll of the natural primitive life which Gauguin sought when he set off for Polynesia. He combined this romantic dream with his vivid impressions of the exotic landscape and wildlife, the unusual appearance of the islanders and their natural grace, their mysterious beliefs and rituals. One of the Tahitian girls is playing a flute: the Tahitians devoted flute music to the goddess of the Moon. It is evening, when the sun sets and the times of ritual dances and music in honour of the goddess begin. Beside the dog is what is probably a vessel for sacrifices of small birds and such like, carved out of a pumpkin. The painting is made up of a combination of pure colours, a rhythmic arrangement of lines and broad areas of colour, which is in harmony with the musical theme.

The famous traveller Bengt Danielsson, when he saw the place where Gauguin worked, emphasised the truthfulness of this depiction: \"The population had been so decimated that... as in this painting, one could rarely see more than one rider or passerby.\" The bright light and colour of the islands of Oceania is conveyed by generalised areas of resonant, sharp colours. The large tree at the foot of the mountain becomes the central component in this landscape and is also to be found in other works by the artist. With time this mountain became part of Gauguin's system of spiritual and symbolic images, linked with the Tahitian goddess of the Moon.

This painting recalls his native Holland and the garden of his parents' house at Etten. The artist's impressions of the bright sun and resonant colours of the south were combined with nostalgia for home. Working in Arles alongside Gauguin, he came under the strong influence of the latter's style, which can be seen in the flattened space and the broad areas of colour outlined with thick contours. But van Gogh's powerful romantic temperament demanded expression in a more dramatic style that was to be found in Gauguin's work, and he used intense colouring and rough surface texture to create an individual artistic language which expressed both the energy and drama of life.

The subject of this painting is a bullfight at the ancient amphitheatre, and yet the arena is barely noticeable, for the main motif is the public, the colourful crowd gathered to watch the popular spectacle. Amongst the viewers we can see the artist's friends and acquaintances that he so often depicted in other canvaes. During the period when this painting was produced, Gauguin was working in Arles alongside van Gogh and the latter was much taken with his fellow artist's painting style. Note the flattened space and the replacement of individual strokes with general patches of colour, outlined with a broad dark contour. Yet in the expressiveness of the painting we see van Gogh's own powerful temperament and his deeply dramatic perception of the world. Having passed through an Impressionist phase, the artist moved on to create his own personal, intense artistic language.

Van Gogh depicted a lilac bush in the hospital gardens, the broken, separate brushstrokes and vibrant forms recalling the lessons of Impressionism, yet with a spatial dynamism unknown to the Impressionists. This bush is full of powerful, vivid energy and dramatic expression. The modest natural motif is transformed by the master's temperament and the brilliance of his emotions. Embodied here in this fragment of an overgrown garden we find all of nature's life-giving forces. In rejecting Impressionism, Van Gogh created his own artistic language, expressing the artist's romantic, passionate and deeply dramatic perception of the world.

He repeated the motif of peasant juts on many occasions: \"In my opinion, the most marvellous of all that I know in the sphere of architecture is huts with their roofs of moss-grown straw and a smoky hearth,\" wrote van Gogh in one of his letters. The thatched roofs seem to be just as much an organic part of nature as the hills, fields and sky. The hilly relief of the distance allowed the artist to accentuate the dynamics of space, which he reinforced through the use of colour contrasts. The tense, wavy brushstrokes and lines convey the dramatism of the artist's perception of life and the world.

Executed in 1876-1877, it was originally called The Wounded Warrior. It shows a naked youth holding a spear, depicted with unsual realism, without idealization and generalization. Rodin was throwing out a challenge to academic art, and critics even accused him of taking a cast from the model, the result was so lifelike. Only the intervention of a group of artists put an end to the accusations. For all the detailed moulding, which reveals a careful study of the model, everything is subjugated to the overall conception, motion as an expression of emotion. The title, The Bronze Age, reflects the legend of two different periods in the history of mankind, under which a happy era was described as a golden age and an unhappy era as bronze. The young man feeling the awakening of his strength, seems to anticipate the cataclysms which are threatening to the world.

In its subject, it is more close to the Kiss which is part of this complex work, including 186 sculptures. Originally, it was called Zephyr and the Earth or The Youth. This image of lovers embodies the poetry of youthful sensuality. Rodin employed a special method of working the stone, generalizing form, not finishing the marble in the hollows. The outline seems to be dim and the white marble to let light into its surface, creating an impression of purity and chastity in a scene of love.

He was interested in the light and colour interaction within the intimate space of a room, while his predecessors were engaged in representing this interaction in the open air. In the artist's works interiors are rather an emotional medium penetrated with comfort and tranquillity than a background for his characters (in this case depicted are probably Vuillard's nephews). A balcony or a window depicted in the background is one of his most important devices: the diffused light flowing from the outside fills the interior, absorbing bright colours and transforming the shapes into a decorative patch; and only the contours of the carpet, screen and balcony railings, which form the structural basis of the composition, are left well defined.

This canvas, shown at the “Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings 0.10” in Petrograd in December 1915, embodied its creator’s conception of “the zero of form”, the beginning and end of everything. All shapes and phenomena are implied within this zero, in it they expire and are born anew in an infinite and eternal space. As the artist wrote: “The Square is not a subconscious shape. It is the creation of intuitive reason. The face of the new art! The Square is alive, a royal infant. The first step of pure creativity in art.” The artist repeated the famous composition, which undoubtedly became an icon of 20th century painting. The Hermitage has a version dated ca. 1930, it was formerly kept in the collection of the Malevich family.

Impressions, born under the influence of the outside world, and improvisations, reflecting inner emotional experience, were created in isolation from figurativeness, but still retained a link with reality. It was in the third type of painting, compositions, that Kandinsky’s long years of creative searching found their fullest expression. The essence of the artist’s creative work shifted into the expressiveness of line and colours that are not connected with the world of objects and are directed to the sphere of emotions and sensations. The starting point for Composition VI was a picture on glass called The Flood that the artist sought to rethink. An inner sense of catastrophe, expressed in an abstract form, is the content of the canvas.

He graduated from a military college in Moscow but then studied in the Academy of Arts in St Petersburg under Ilya Repin. It is possible to detect the influence of Van Gogh’s artistic idiom in Jawlensky’s works. At present, all the museums and private collections in Russia possess no more than twenty of this artist’s pictures. The Hermitage has a small-sized, but significant canvas by him from the period of the Neue Künstlervereinigung München, an association that Jawlensky formed together with Wassily Kandinsky and Marianne von Werefkin, which became a forerunner of Der Blaue Reiter. The display of this piece in the same hall as paintings by Kandinsky makes it possible to see how exactly the understanding and capabilities of Expressionism evolved in the output of artists working side by side, at the same time, in the same intellectual milieu, men who were friends and may have shared their ideas.

Gros embodied in the image of Napoleon the ideal of a strong, wilful individual typical of neoclassical art. The figure strains forward, face cold and calm, with a tense gaze emphasizing the hero's decisiveness and bravery. At the same time Gros's painting is suffused with a mood which foreshadows the Romantic era, reflected in the dynamic colour and light-and-shade contrasts and the temperamental painterly manner.

By her first marriage she was wife of Viscount Alexandre de Beauharnais, general and deputy of the noblesse in the Estates-General who was convicted and executed for high treason on 28 July 1794. After her husband's death Josephine was imprisoned but soon released due to the patronage of Viscount Barras, a member of the Directoire. In 1796 she married General Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1799 she became the owner of the Palace of Malmaison (Chateau de Malmaison). In 1804-09 she was the Empress of France. This portrait of Joséphine was painted in 1801 by François Gérard, one of the most popular society painters during the periods of the Consulate and the First Empire. In spite of its large size, the portrait is stripped of official pomposity. Joséphine is represented full length, sitting on a sofa, against an open terrace of the Palace of Malmaisonas if she were taking a rest after the walk. The white dress in the “classical style” accentuates her graciousness and the repose of her attitude. The park-like landscape and a small bunch of flowers on the sofa create a sentimental poetic mood, underlying the inner state of the sitter. The idealization of the model and the static composition built upon a balance of horizontal and vertical lines are very much within the traditions of Neoclassicism.

Sappho and Phaon is a characteristic example of his late work. In the painting we see the Ancient Greek poetess Sappho and her beloved, Phaon. Cupid, who holds out to Sappho a lyre (emblem of music and poetry), symbolizes the idea of love as a source of creative inspiration. On Sappho's knees is a scroll with a Greek inscription, the first lines of her First Ode: dedicated to Phaon. The historically convincing depiction of Classical attire, shoes and details in the interior is combined with a sentimental, lyrical interpretation of loving harmony, revealed in the languid voluptuousness of the poses, and even such traditional metaphors for love as the pair of kissing doves and the two trees in the landscape.

At the left by the head of the bed is the empty scabbard, and on the table to the right a lamp and scroll with an inscription in Greek, indicating that before his death Cato, as is stated in the Parallel Lives, was reading Plato's dialogue On the Immortality of the Soul. Lethiere's painting is a typical example of the painting of Neoclassicism, which was popular in the decade after the French Revolution of 1789. The subject was deliberately selected with a didactic purpose, to be an example of bravery and stoicism. This death-bed is treated with all the idealization inherent in the Neoclassical style, without any naturalistic details. The composition recalls a bas-relief, with the subject stretched along the foreground of the painting, while the modelling of forms and the hero's pose are borrowed from the Ancient Roman sculpture of The Dying Gaul, evidence of the deliberate imitation of Antique art. Cato?s head resembles the features of Brutus the Elder, first consul of the Roman Republic, depicted in the famous sculptural bust Brutus (early 3rd century BC, Capitoline Museums, Rome).

In terms of style his landscapes are also monotonous: a static composition, calligraphically precise drawing and a cold, light colour scheme dominated by light blue and green in the depiction of the sky, sea and foliage, contrasting with the warm, sandy-brown tones of the earth and architectural structures.

In this painting we see the royal suite of courtiers out hunting frozen in horror as they see the king approaching, deep in conversation with a peasant whom he has allowed to get up behind him on the royal horse. The treatment of the landscape reveals a synthesis of the traditions of Dutch and Flemish art - in the curious details and captivating narrative - and the conventions of the classical landscape - the sketchy figures, the use of trees to form \"wings\" leading towards the centre, and the building up of depth through layers of horizontal planes.

The portrait of Murat is marked by a fine depiction of the physical characteristics of the face (the low brows, straight nose and projecting chin) and at the same time by great emotional expressiveness.

Decamps dreamed of a career of a historical painter, but his hopes did not come true. He belonged to the group of the so-called Lesser Romantic artists who were fond of Oriental subjects. In the Hermitage self-portrait he is depicted in an Oriental robe, wearing a fez on his head. But unlike many Lesser Romantic artists, Decamps selected a subject as just a means to solve purely painterly problems.

Josephine’s son did not hold the position for long, however. After Napoleon’s forces were defeated at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, the Confederation disintegrated. Since Eugène Beauharnais, who later became first Duke of Leuchtenberg, had been Dalberg’s successor, it has been conjectured in scholarly literature that the Hermitage portrait came from the Leuchtenberg ducal collection.

Boilly's genre paintings are marked by entertaining plots and abundance of details. In the foreground, seated beneath the shade of a large tree, is a group of ageing gentlemen listening eagerly to the latest newspaper events, each depicted in an expressive pose, with his own individual gestures and mimicry. The scene is represented with good-natured humour. Boilly meticulously depicted the male and female cloths, the ladies' hats and gentlemen's headdresses, canes, chairs, summer-houses and children's toys. It seems that the artist does not go beyond a simple description of everyday life.

Delaroche depicted Sontag in the costume of Donna Anna from Mozart's opera Don Giovanni. This role, which the singer first performed in Paris in 1828, was one of the best in her repertoire. The strict composition is softened by the gentle incline of the head. The thoughtful dreamy gaze endows the face with a melancholy sadness.

In the foreground he depicted two hunters - a man and a youth - beneath the luxurious crown of a tree, as well as two Arabs in the background with a horse. The outlines of the figures and the rock, the twisted trunks of the trees create a sense of tension. The rifle in the hands of one of the hunters and the unsheathed sabre lying on the ground emphasize that things are coming to an end. The dramatism so typical of Romanticism is created here by energetic brushstrokes and the contrast of complementary colours - red and green, blue and orange - and light and dark patches: the dark green foliage and shaded rock seem to be more tangible in contrast with the sky and the mountain stream.

His unfailing interest in the depiction of scenes from the life of the Muslim world gave him a reputation as an \"ethnographic\" artist, of which he was very proud. His orientalizing compositions are often of great documentary value. Gérome produced very precise representations not only of exotic costume, architecture and interiors, but also of different ethnic types. In the Hermitage painting we see a Turkish bath in a harem. In the centre, lit through a window in the ceiling, we see two white women and a dark-skinned slave; in the depth, by the pool, are the smaller figures of naked odalisques. With pedantic care Gérome painted the figures and the details of the setting: the smooth surface of the marble floor, the coloured tiles, the furniture and the clothing. The style of Gérome's oriental works, realistic in content and classicizing in technique, is often described as \"academic realism\".

Being of peasant origin, Millet knew from his own experience the hard rural life.

Their low-sunk heads and bent backs, the slow steps and hands tightly gripping the cord tell us of the utmost tension of their force.

Following the traditions of Western European landscape painting, he had an impact on the formation of such Impressionists as Monet, Sisley and Pissarro. This painting is a typical work by Corot. It combines the classical clarity of composition, the emotional perception of nature of the Romantic artists and the realistic observation in the rendition of illumination effects. The composition of this painting is based on a contrast between the dark foreground and the bright distance. Between the flanking high trees, seen as dark silhouettes against the pinkish-yellow clouds, a distant panorama opens up. The warm light of the setting sun slips across the leaves, colouring the sky on the horizon with pearly-golden tones. The small figures in Corot's works (here the gatherers of brushwood) link the art of the painter with pictures by Jean François Millet, Gustave Courbet and the artists of the Barbizon School.

To the right, the thick spreading crowns of the trees appear as a dark silhouette against the light sky.

Daubigny painted nearly all his works from life, with the exception of large canvases. At the end of the 1850s the artist built a boat-studio, on board of which he created many landscapes travelling along the rivers Loing, Oise and Seine. Here we see a sunny summer day. The composition resembling a fragment of a large panorama is built up of alternating planes in a manner typical of Daubigny: a blue ribbon of the river, then a bank with its emerald-green grass, a little village in the distance, and the pale blue sky with floating clouds. The tiny bright red spots which indicate the cottage roofs reinforce the sense of spatial depth.

In this painting we can feel the silence of the early summer morning in the half-dark and damp air of the forest. Corot had his own particular way of conveying trees - the crowns were picked out by just a few dulled greenish-brown tones, over which the artist applied small, broken silvery-green strokes with an almost dry brush. In this manner the artist achieved the impression of moving, shimmering leaves. The colouring, with limited variations around a single tonality as was typical of Corot's work, is enlivened by the white trunk of the birch-tree and the red hat of the fisherman who stands by the side of the pool.

He produced his paintings mainly in the area around Compiègne and Montmorency. This work is typical of his output, with his inherent talent for conveying the light-and-air medium. On this warm summer day a herd of cows are calmly grazing on the edge of a forest. The sunlight softly gilds the tops of the trees, which stand out against the sky. In the mirror-like surface of the forest pond gathering clouds are reflected.

His idyllically pastoral paintings depicting Venus and Cupid were a great success at the Paris Salons. The sentimental and lyrical treatment of the subject and the peculiarities of the artist's painterly manner betray the influence of the Old Masters and his predecessors, such as Correggio and Prud'hon. It was no accident that the artist's contemporaries called him the \"Barbizon Correggio\". Diaz's compositions with large figures are marked by subtle modelling of forms, soft chiaroscuro, rich colour scheme and velvety paint texture.

Her father was Major General Esper Alexandrovich Beloselsky-Belozersky (1802–1846) and her mother was a prominent lady of the court, maid-of-honour Yelena Pavlovna Bibikova (1812–1888). In July 1855, Olga, by then herself a maid-of-honour, married Count Pavel Andreyevich Shuvalov (1830–1908). Her husband was the adjutant to Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolayevich and later in life served briefly as governor general of Warsaw (1894–96). Olga Esperovna and her husband spent the late 1850s in France, where he had been sent by the Ministry of War to perform military and diplomatic commissions at the court of Emperor Napoleon III. Olga Esperovna led an active social life in the French capital and was closely acquainted with Empress Eugenie. It was during this period that Winterhalter painted the present portrait. Olga Esperovna is depicted in a white dress trimmed with a lace collar and cuffs and a lilac-coloured sash belt. The artist has reduced the amount of adornments to a minimum and we see only a pearl earring in her left ear and part of a gold chain around her neck. Winterhalter did not resort to a striking pose. He showed his model sitting calmly in an armchair in a state of wistful thoughtfulness, gazing not at the viewer, but off to the side. The artist concentrated attention on the face, with the head shown in a three-quarter turn. As a result of this approach, which was unusual for Winterhalter, he produced a portrait with a rare depth of penetration into the subject’s personality.

In accordance with a tradition which dated back to the time of Maria Fyodovna, wife of Paul I (reigned 1796-1801), Maria Alexandrovna was patroness of many charitable organisations in Russia, in particular the Red Cross. With her assistance, schools and girls colleges were set up across the country. Due to her fragile health, Maria Alexandrovna lived a very retired life in her last years. In this portrait by the famous society painter Franz Winterhalter, she is shown standing in slight three-quarter view. The elegant crossed arms and rich attire, the luxurious jewels and fan, create an imposing picture of a lady of society. But there is a barely noticeable incline of the head, a pale wanness to the serious, thoughtful gaze, which tell us that Maria Alexandrovna was in fact totally immersed in her own internal world.

However, the painterly qualities of this work do not allow to rank it among the Salon pictures. It is a genre scene: a girl returns home after a walk with a bouquet of wild flowers. Her wide-brimmed straw hat attractively frames her pretty face, with its open, welcoming gaze. Her half-naked breast, the raised skirt and carelessly tied kerchief create the impression of naturalness and slight piquancy. The girl's figure is harmoniously set into an oval. Roqueplan's composition, which is without any pretension to depth or significance of meaning, yet attracts our attention with the ingenuous image of the young girl.

Yet his consistent success with the public was not so much the result of painting talent as an ability to flatter his sitters, combining a good likeness of the sitter with a large dose of idealisation. This portrait of Nadezhda Polovtseva is typical of his work, an eclectic combination of realistic trends and the achievements of Impression with the traditional devices of the academic school. Polovtseva is shown in a luxurious interior, the dynamic contrast of her three-quarter pose, the frontal depiction of her face and hands, the upright, aristocratic bearing and deliberately impressive drapery folds of her dress give the portrait an imposing elegance. Nadezhda Polovtseva (1843-1908) was the adopted daughter of Baron Stieglitz, founder of the Stieglitz Museum and Central School of Industrial Arts in St Petersburg. She married Alexander Polovstev, Russian Secretary of State and a passionate art collector, who did much to enhance the collections of the Stieglitz Museum, while she herself became director of the School. She was painted by Carolus-Duran during his visit to St Petersburg in 1876.

This portrait was painted to a commission from Nicholas I for the Small Field Marshals’ Hall of the Winter Palace. It shows Suvorov in the uniform of an Adjutant General with an impressive display of orders: of the White Eagle, St Vladimir third class, St Anne third class, St George fourth class, St Stanislas third class, the Red Eagle (Prussia), Leopold (Austria), Francis I (Kingdom of the Two Sicilies), the Dannebrog (Denmark), Virtuti Militari (Poland), the Lion and Sun (Persia) and the Annunciata (Italy), plus a Maltese Cross and the badge for 25 years’ impeccable service.

made of relief incrustation of faceted diamonds and emeralds in a gold setting. Tendrils of vegetable ornament are rendered in green enamel. This Indian master was a virtuoso of the enamel technique. The technique of producing champleve enamel was already known in India by the end of the 16th century and may have been borrowed from Europe. Certainly there were French jewellers working at the court of the Great Moguls, decorating luxurious objects with enamel. The cup comes from the treasury of the Great Moguls, stolen by the Iranian ruler Nadir-Shah (1736-47) when he took Delhi in 1739. In the autumn of that year Nadir-Shah sent an embassy to Russia carrying magnificent gifts for the Empress Anna Ioannovna (1730-40), amongst them this cup. The embassy took two years to travel the road (on elephants) and by the time they arrived a new empress was on the throne, Elizabeth Petrovna (1741-61). Later the cup was presented by Empress Elizabeth to her lady-in-waiting Anastasia of Hesse-Homburg (nee Trubetskaya). It is interesting to note that for some time the cup stood on the lady?s-in-waiting tomb.

They became particularly popular in Russia in the 18th century and could be of various sizes. Smaller necessaires were intended to be portable, serving as part of a woman's jewellery, worn on a short chain with little hooks - known as a chatelaine - attached to the waist. It is thought that this necessaire was presented to Empress Yelizaveta Petrovna (1709-1761), daughter of Peter the Great, by the French ambassador at the Russian court to mark the Easter celebrations, which explains the egg-shaped form. It held a perfume bottle, scissors and little files. Beneath the upper lid is the monogram EI and an inscription. The lower lid is decorated with the Russian two-headed eagle and the arms of Moscow, plus the sign of the Order of St Andrew the First-Called. The necessaire is decorated with cut diamonds and two painted enamel landscapes in gilded rococo frames. Above is an inscription in French: Si. Vous. Me Regardez. Je. Serai. Regardee and Nie. Pour. Orner. Une. Couronne.

all important artistic trends of Thai art from the 14th to 19th century. The majority of items were transferred from the collection of George Plançon, a Russian envoy to the court of King Rama V Chulalongkorn of Siam from 1910 to 1916. It is noteworthy that the collection includes two dated items as well as objects bearing inscriptions translated by the world-famous researcher Hans Penth (Chiangmai University, Northern Thailand). The art of Siam, as a sacral art, reflects the doctrine of Southern Buddhism, which had formed in Sri Lanka by the 13th century and then spread all around Indo-China including Siam (the name of Thailand from the late 16th century to 1939). For Thai people the Buddha is rather a reminder of the Buddhist Doctrine than a deity. According to orthodox notions of Thai people, any of the Buddha's images bears a portion of his innate spiritual energy. The ethical nature of Thai Buddhism accounts for a great number of the Buddha's images in Siam, exceeding now the population of Thailand. This table decoration was presented by Rama V, King of Siam, to Russian Crown Prince Nikolai Alexandrovich during his trip to the East in 1890-91. Three hamsa birds support two bowls, one inserted into the other. Vessels of the similar design were used by Siamese crown princes as trays for betel (chewing of betel was an important part of everyday life at the Siamese court). Four sides of this two-tiered octahedral pedestal show crowned coats-of-arms, two of which are Russian, while the other two are Siamese.
