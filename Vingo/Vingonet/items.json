    "description": " In this work, painted in Issy-les-Moulineaux near Paris in 1911, Matisse depicted his sons Jean and Pierre, deep in a game of draughts, his daughter Marguerite and his wife Amelie. In itself a family portrait set in an interior is a simple and natural idea; it could have been intimate and emotional, but ever true to himself, the artist moved beyond mere intimacy to make the composition monumental and majestic. The structure of this large canvas is unusual. Matisse takes us into a world of whimsical patterns - now childishly naive, now of oriental complexity - which incorporate the draughts board, one of the most important elements in the painting. This patterning might have threatened the compositional unity of the work, but Matisse, as it were challenging the multiplicity of colours and lines he had created, managed to achieve clarity and logic through careful organisation of the canvas. The figures play the central role in establishing the unity of the painting. It is they - as always in the artist's works shown with a clear and simple outline - who contain, concentrated within themselves, the most resonant colour: the red of the boy's clothes, and black dress and the lemon-yellow book. Matisse has created a vast, tense world, the air vibrant with deep spiritual concentration, which seems almost tangible in the blue-black of the mirror over the fireplace. ",

    "description": " This work was painted during Matisse's first trip to Morocco in 1912. His many new, strong impressions gained during that first acquaintance with the Orient, the direct contact with a world so very different from his own, demanded new means of expression adequate both to his thoughts and emotions and to the Orient itself. Avoiding overt oriental exoticism and ethnographical pedantry, Matisse filled the painting with his joy at the natural informality of the model, joy at the sun, joy at light-filled colour. The youth, a stable-hand at a Tangiers hotel, stands easily and naturally, the narrow canvas format complementing his long-legged, light figure. Matisse captures the dark skin, the bright white shirt, the pure colours of the waistcoat and short trouserss. The figure of Amido has mass and volume and yet is somewhat asymmetrical, twisted in space, creating a sense of dynamism, despite the boy's calm pose. Matisse selected this painting for the Moscow collector Sergey Shchukin. ",

    "description": " Matisse painted this portrait of Lydia Delectorskaya eight years after the Young Woman in a Blue Blouse (also in the Hermitage). We no longer see the captivating charm of youth and tenderness. Here the harsh line which divides the face into planes of yellow and blue makes the image something mysterious and inevitable. The bright sunny side of the face and its mysterous blue alter-ego are like light and shade, the eternal contrasts which lie within the human soul. Combined, these two colours give birth to the green of the luxuriant hair which forms a marvellous crown on the woman's head. Through the use of colour contrasts and ornamental expressiveness, the artist with deceptive simplicity conveys the unusual nature of this model, who so captivated him over the last years of his life.

    "description": " Matisse painted this portrait of his wife in the summer of 1913, in the garden of his house at Issy-les-Moulineaux near Paris. Amelie posed for her husband in a green garden chair, looking elegant, relaxed and firmly in control. Her pose is precisely but simply conveyed, her erect back and her perfect dress-sense making her the very epitome of the Parisian \"dame\". The artist made use of the traditional scheme of an official, society portrait, but gave it a totally untraditional resonance. Amelie's face lies in greenish shade. The simple outline and severely schematic features recall a mask, something which not only hides the inner essence of the sitter but embodies some mysterious content which cannot be explained by logic or clarity. In 1914 this painting, which enjoyed phenomenal success with contemporary critics, was acquired by the collector Sergey Shchukin. ",

    "description": " The artist was in Morocco between October 1912 and February 1913, during which time he painted this small composition, which incorporates a still life, interior and a landscape. Although painted in oils, the composition is so light and airy as to seem more like a watercolour. The deliberate and expressive contrast of green and greyish-blue tones works with the softly shining yellow to create a sense of soft sunny light. Matisse mixed areas of colour with patches of unpainted, white primed canvas, which are particularly effective when used to set off the colour of the flowers. Cold and elegant, these flowers are outlined with a light, precise contour, its smokey-grey colour harmonising with the colour structure of the whole painting. ",
